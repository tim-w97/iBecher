# How to use this app?

### Mug Checker

Pick a random mug you want to check.
Hold the camera above your mug until the lid covers your mug.
Then hold the camera sideways to the mug and move the slider at the bottom, until the lid matches the height of your mug.
If the lid is still green, your mug fits in the machine. If the lid gets red, the mug is too high.

### Coffee Tracker and Coffee Consumption Overview

Use the Coffee Tracker to track your coffee purchases. 
You can calculate the price for a coffee by selecting the mug type (paper mug / your own cup) and the size of the coffee.
After your added a purchase, you can have a quick look at your coffee consumption by filtering all your purchases by week, month, year and total.
